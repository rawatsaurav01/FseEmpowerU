## Problem Statement: Creating a Constructor Based Circular Dependency

* This is a simple spring application containing a circular dependency between two classes.

To do the exercise, complete the following steps:

**Note**: Classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors when the exercise is cloned locally.
You need to go through the comments thoroughly and complete the application.

    1. Manage Dependencies in pom.xml.
    2. Complete the classes and methods by analyzing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors.
    3. Implement the methods:
        - use constructor based dependency injection in UserService to inject OrderService
        - use constructor based dependency injection in OrderService to inject UserService
    4. Implement the functionality of the methods, and ensure that all the test cases pass
