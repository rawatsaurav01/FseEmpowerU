# Resolution of Vectors

Resolution of a vector can be done for any finite dimension. But we will discuss only in two and 
three dimensions. Let us start with two dimension.

### Resolution of a vector in two dimension

# Theorem 8.5
Let ˆ ˆ i j and be the unit vectors along the positive x-axis and the y-axis having initial point at 
the origin O. NowOP
 is the position vector of any point P in the plane. Then OP
 can be uniquely 
written as

OP
 = xi y j ˆ ˆ + for some real numbers x and y. Further |OP
 | = 2 2
